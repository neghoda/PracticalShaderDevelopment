# PracticalShaderDevelopment

Code that I wrote while reading *Practical Shader Development* by Kyle Halladay

Unlike [code from the book](https://github.com/Apress/practical-shader-dev), these examples don't depend on openFramework, and build on top of OpenGL abstraction layer that I took from *Hands On C++ Game Animation Programming* by Gabour Szauer

Samples should work without the need to install anything(except Visual Studio, of course). There are no code for Unreal, Unity and Godot chapters thou.Â 

## TODO
- Remove GLSL struct uniform hack from Shader.cpp in Chapter12_FixedLightCount
- Proper Sample::Shutdown() for every example

## Dependencies
- [glad](https://glad.dav1d.de)
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
- [happly](https://github.com/nmwsharp/happly)
